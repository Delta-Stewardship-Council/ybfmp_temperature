## f_get

This is an R Markdown document detailing the data and scripts within the Yolo Bypass Fish Moniroting Program (YBFMP) water temperature repo. 

Within the data_clean folder, the raw (years combined) temperature logger data from the Yolo Bypass rotary screw trap and Sherwood Harbor locations is rstr_98_18.csv and shw_98_20.csv, respectively. Those data are made into daily QC'ed datasets - rstr_98_18_daily_logger.csv and SHWharbor_98_20_daily_logger.csv.

The f_get functions bring in the raw data from the data_raw folder and relevant EDI publications.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## f_make

The f_make functions impute missing dates of water temperature data when consecutive missing days are less than or equal to one week (seven days). Otherwise a linear model is used to estimate water temperature on days when data gaps are larger than seven days.

For the Yolo Bypass, the water temperature collected during fish sampling is incorporated into the water temperature time series before imputation. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

## clean data

Each clean_ dataset incudes columns date, mean, max, min, sd, cv, n, method, category and site.
